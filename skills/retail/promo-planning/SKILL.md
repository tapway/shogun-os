# Promo Planning

Promotional calendar management, display allocation by store cluster, signage generation, and post-promo analysis. Plans, executes, and measures the effectiveness of retail promotions.

## Overview

The Promo Planning skill manages the full lifecycle of retail promotions from calendar planning through post-promo analysis. It allocates promotional displays across store clusters, generates in-store signage, and measures incremental lift, margin impact, and return on investment.

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Incremental Lift | Sales uplift vs non-promo period | > 20% |
| Margin Impact | Margin % change during promo | < -5% |
| Display Compliance | % of stores with correct display | > 90% |
| Promo ROI | (Incremental profit - Promo cost) / Promo cost | > 3x |
| Redemption Rate | % of promo offers redeemed | Varies |
| Sell-Through | % of promo stock sold | > 80% |

## Usage

## Pitfalls

- **Promotion cannibalization**: Promotions on one SKU can cannibalize sales of non-promoted SKUs in the same category. Track category-level P&L, not just promo SKU sales.
- **Promotion fatigue**: Running promotions too frequently trains customers to wait for discounts. Limit promotions to no more than 30% of selling days per category.
- **Display allocation fairness**: Stores with limited space cannot accommodate all displays. Create a display priority matrix based on store size and traffic.
- **Signage lead time**: In-store signage requires 2-3 weeks for design, approval, printing, and distribution. Factor this into calendar planning.
- **Post-promo dip**: Sales often drop below baseline immediately after a promotion ends. Plan for a 1-2 week recovery period before launching the next category promotion.
