# Loyalty Program

Points accrual rule configuration, tier management (Silver/Gold/Platinum), automated birthday and promotion triggers, rewards catalog management, and redemption tracking analytics.

## Overview

The Loyalty Program skill manages the full lifecycle of customer loyalty initiatives. It configures points earning rules, manages membership tiers, triggers automated promotions, maintains a rewards catalog, and tracks redemption patterns to measure program effectiveness.

| Component | Description | Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Points Accrual | Rules for earning points per transaction | 1 point per $1 |
| Tier Progression | Customer advancement between tiers | Tracked quarterly |
| Redemption Rate | % of issued points redeemed | > 30% |
| Program ROI | Incremental revenue from program | > 5x program cost |
| Active Member % | % of enrolled members with recent activity | > 60% |
| Churn Rate | % of members lapsing per period | < 10% |

      - "1 point per $1 spent"
      - "Birthday bonus: 100 points"
  - name: "Gold"
    min_points_ytd: 5000

      - "Birthday bonus: 200 points"
      - "Free shipping on orders above $50"
  - name: "Platinum"
    min_points_ytd: 15000

## Scripts

### `scripts/points-engine.py`

Core points calculation engine. Applies accrual rules per transaction, handles bonus points for promotions and birthdays, and manages point expiry schedules.

### `scripts/tier-manager.py`

Evaluates customer tier eligibility quarterly. Promotes qualifying members, demotes non-qualifying members, and sends tier change notifications.

### `scripts/redemption-tracker.py`

Tracks reward redemptions across all channels. Generates reports on most popular rewards, redemption patterns, and points liability.

### `scripts/loyalty-roi.py`

Calculates program ROI by comparing incremental revenue from loyalty members against program costs (points liability, marketing, operations).

## Pitfalls

- **Points liability accounting**: Unredeemed points represent a balance sheet liability. Accrue points liability at the time of issuance, not redemption.
- **Tier demotion backlash**: Customers react negatively to tier demotions. Consider a grace period (3 months) before demoting and communicate proactively.
- **Promotion stacking**: Birthday bonuses combined with other promotions can create unexpected discount stacking. Define stacking rules explicitly.
- **Points expiry communication**: Points expiry can trigger customer complaints. Send multiple reminders (30 days, 14 days, 7 days before expiry).
- **Fraud detection**: Monitor for abnormal points earning patterns (e.g., high-value transactions followed by immediate returns). Implement velocity checks on point accrual.
