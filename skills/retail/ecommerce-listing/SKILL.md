## Pitfalls

- **API rate limits**: Marketplace APIs have strict rate limits. Implement retry with exponential backoff and avoid bulk updates during peak trading hours.
- **Image compliance drift**: Platform requirements change. Check image specs quarterly rather than assuming they're static.
- **Title truncation**: Different platforms render titles differently on mobile vs desktop. Test SEO titles on actual devices before full rollout.
- **Inventory race conditions**: Simultaneous orders on different platforms can cause overselling. Implement a centralized inventory buffer with 5-10% safety stock.
- **Category taxonomy changes**: Marketplaces occasionally restructure category trees. Monitor for category mapping errors during sync.
