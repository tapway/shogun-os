# Marketplace Analytics

Sales performance by platform and channel, advertising spend ROI analysis, competitor pricing monitoring, and customer review sentiment analysis. Provides actionable intelligence for marketplace strategy.

## Overview

The Marketplace Analytics skill aggregates data from all connected ecommerce platforms to provide a unified view of channel performance. It tracks ad spend efficiency, monitors competitor pricing, and analyzes customer review sentiment to identify opportunities and threats.

| Dimension | Metrics | Source |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Sales by Platform | GMV, orders, AOV, conversion rate | Shopee, Lazada APIs |
| Advertising ROI | Spend, impressions, clicks, ACOS | Platform ad managers |
| Competitor Pricing | Price gap, stock status, promotions | Scraped data |
| Review Sentiment | Rating distribution, keywords, trends | Platform review APIs |
| Category Trends | Category growth, share, seasonality | Aggregated data |

## Pitfalls

- **Data freshness**: Marketplace analytics APIs have data latency (typically 24-48 hours). Clearly label data freshness in all reports.
- **Attribution models**: Platform attribution models differ. Shopee and Lazada may credit different touchpoints for the same conversion. Never compare raw attribution numbers across platforms.
- **Competitor scraping legality**: Automated competitor price monitoring may violate platform terms of service. Use platform-provided APIs where available and verify compliance.
- **Sentiment sampling bias**: Only a fraction of customers leave reviews. Sentiment analysis reflects the reviewing population, not the entire customer base.
- **Ad platform attribution windows**: Different attribution windows (7-day click vs 30-day view) produce vastly different ROAS numbers. Standardize on one window and document it.
