# HSE Incident Management

Manages Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) incidents from reporting through investigation and closure. Covers all incident types with severity classification, investigation workflow, and leading/lagging indicator tracking.

## Incident Types

| Type | Description | Severity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Near-miss | Unsafe event with no injury or damage | Low |
| First Aid | Minor injury treated on-site | Low |
| Medical Treatment | Injury requiring professional medical care | Medium |
| Restricted Work | Injury limiting work activities | Medium |
| LTI (Lost Time Injury) | Injury causing lost work time | High |
| Fatality | Work-related death | Critical |
| Environmental | Spill, release, or environmental violation | Variable |
| Property Damage | Equipment or facility damage | Variable |

## Severity Matrix

| Likelihood ↓ / Consequence → | Minor | Moderate | Major | Critical |
|------------------------------|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| Almost Certain | Medium | High | Critical | Critical |
| Likely | Medium | High | High | Critical |
| Possible | Low | Medium | High | High |
| Unlikely | Low | Low | Medium | High |
| Rare | Low | Low | Medium | Medium |

## Usage

### Report Incident

```
hse report --type near_miss --description "Slippery floor near line 3"
          --location "Plant A, Line 3" --reporter "John Doe"
```

### Incident Investigation

```
hse investigate INC-2024-001234 --root-cause "Inadequate spill response training"
```

### Record Leading Indicator

```
hse leading --indicator "safety_training_completed" --value 42 --month 2024-01
```

### Safety Dashboard

```
hse dashboard --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD
```

### LTI Rate Calculation

```
hse lti-rate --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD [--plant PLANT_ID]
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HSE_DATA_PATH` | Path to incident data storage | `./data/hse/` |
| `HSE_REPORTING_HOURS` | Hours to report after incident (regulatory) | `24` |
| `HSE_LTI_BASE_HOURS` | Base hours for LTI rate calculation | `200000` |
| `HSE_AUTO_ESCALATE_DAYS` | Days before investigation auto-escalation | `7` |
| `HSE_ESCALATION_CONTACTS` | Escalation contact list | `hse_manager,plant_manager,regional_hse` |
| `HSE_REGULATORY_BODY` | Applicable regulatory standard | `OSHA` |

### Leading & Lagging Indicators

| Indicator | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) | Lagging | Standard industry safety metric |
| Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) | Lagging | LTI per million hours worked |
| Near-miss Reporting Rate | Leading | Near-misses reported per period |
| Safety Training Completion | Leading | Percentage of required training completed |
| Safety Observation Rate | Leading | Observations submitted per person per month |
| Hazard Closure Rate | Leading | Percentage of hazards closed within target |

## Pitfalls

- **Underreporting**: Near-misses are frequently underreported due to fear of blame. Foster a no-blame reporting culture.
- **Classification disputes**: Whether an injury is "First Aid" vs. "Medical Treatment" affects regulatory reporting. Use a clear decision tree.
- **Investigation delay**: Delayed investigations lose evidence and witness memory. Enforce the `HSE_REPORTING_HOURS` window.
- **Leading indicator gaming**: Teams may inflate leading indicators (e.g., reporting trivial observations). Validate indicator quality.
- **Regulatory drift**: HSE regulations change. Periodically review incident classification against current regulatory requirements.
- **LTI rate small numbers**: With small workforces, a single LTI causes large rate swings. Use rolling averages for trend analysis.
