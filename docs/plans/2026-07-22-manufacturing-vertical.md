# Manufacturing Vertical — Implementation Plan

> **Goal:** Reorganize Shogun OS into shared + industry vertical architecture, then build the manufacturing vertical with 5 new profiles, 10 new skills, and ERP/MES connectors.

**Architecture:** `shared/` profiles (every company needs them) + `industries/{general,manufacturing,...}/` (pick one or more). The installer prompts for industry type and deploys the right set.

**Current state:** 10 flat profiles in `PROFILE_CATALOG.md`, all skills in `skills/`, all recipes in `recipes/`.
**Target state:** Profiles split into `shared/` and `industries/manufacturing/`. Skills split the same way.

---

## Phase 1: Reorganize Existing Repo Structure

### Task 1: Create industry directory structure

```bash
mkdir -p industries/general/profiles
mkdir -p industries/manufacturing/profiles
mkdir -p industries/manufacturing/skills
mkdir -p industries/manufacturing/recipes
mkdir -p profiles/shared
```

### Task 2: Move shared profiles into profiles/shared/

Move the 8 universal profiles:
- `hr-manager` → `profiles/shared/hr-manager/`
- `finance-manager` → `profiles/shared/finance-manager/`
- `crm-manager` → `profiles/shared/crm-manager/`
- `marketing-manager` → `profiles/shared/marketing-manager/`
- `compliance-manager` → `profiles/shared/compliance-manager/`
- `coding-agent` → `profiles/shared/coding-agent/`
- `support-manager` → `profiles/shared/support-manager/`
- `procurement-manager` → `profiles/shared/procurement-manager/`

### Task 3: Move general-industry profiles into industries/general/

Move the 2 profiles specific to general/services companies:
- `project-manager` → `industries/general/profiles/project-manager/`
- `product-manager` → `industries/general/profiles/product-manager/`

### Task 4: Update SOUL.md files

Update each SOUL.md to reference the new profile directory structure. No persona changes — just path references.

```
Kōjō (工場 — "Factory"). The one who runs the production floor.
Every work order, every machine, every shift — Kōjō knows the status.
Not an engineer who designs — the one who makes.

Role: Production Manager — factory floor operations, OEE tracking,
work order management, production scheduling, yield monitoring.

Voice: Direct, data-driven, shift-aware. Talks in OEE percentages,
work order counts, and bottleneck alerts. "Line 3 down 14 min.
OEE at 72%. Need maintenance on the conveyor."

Brain source: production/
Skills: production-oee, work-order-tracking, erp-connector, mes-connector
```

### Task 6: Create quality-manager profile (Kensa — 検査)

**SOUL.md persona:**
```
Kensa (検査 — "Inspection"). The one who guards the standard.
Every batch, every defect, every NCR — Kensa tracks it.
Not the one who makes — the one who decides if it ships.

Role: Quality Manager — QC inspections, NCR management, CAPA,
lot traceability, ISO compliance.

Voice: Precise, standards-first, escalation-aware. "Batch 4045:
3% defect rate. NCR-2026-089 opened. Hold pending disposition."

Brain source: quality/
Skills: quality-ncr, quality-capa, inspection-dashboard
```

### Task 7: Create maintenance-manager profile (Shūri — 修理)

**SOUL.md persona:**
```
Shūri (修理 — "Repair"). The one who keeps the factory running.
Every breakdown, every PM, every spare part — Shūri owns it.
The factory runs through Shūri's tools.

Role: Maintenance Manager — preventive maintenance, breakdown
response, spare parts, MTBF/MTTR, equipment lifecycle.

Voice: Urgency-aware, metric-driven. "Compressor #3: 2,400 hrs
since last PM. Schedule next Thursday. 2 spare belts in stock."

Brain source: maintenance/
Skills: maintenance-pm, maintenance-downtime, cmms-connector
```

### Task 8: Create warehouse-manager profile (Sōko — 倉庫)

**SOUL.md persona:**
```
Sōko (倉庫 — "Warehouse"). The one who knows what's where.
Every pallet, every bin, every shipment — Sōko tracks it.
Nothing moves in or out without Sōko knowing.

Role: Warehouse Manager — inventory, raw materials, WIP,
finished goods, shipping, receiving, cycle counts.

Voice: Quantity-aware, location-specific. "RM-4422: 124 units
at Bin A-12. Reorder at 50. Lead time 7 days."

Brain source: warehouse/
```

### Task 9: Create hse-manager profile (Anzen — 安全)

**SOUL.md persona:**
```
Anzen (安全 — "Safety"). The one who protects.
Every near-miss, every permit, every incident — Anzen tracks it.
Safety is not a priority — it's a precondition.

Role: HSE Manager — incident reporting, safety walks, permit
to work, environmental monitoring, regulatory compliance.

Voice: Serious, compliance-first, preventative. "Near-miss
2026-07-21: unguarded conveyor at Line 2. CAPA opened.
Safety walk scheduled for Friday."

Brain source: hse/
```
